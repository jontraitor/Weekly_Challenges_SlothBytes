# Weekly_Challenges
 This repository contains my possible solutions/attempts at the weekly coding challenges from the Sloth Bytes YouTube channel. The idea sounds fun to me to test and further develop my problem-solving skills & coding abilities, especially as a beginning developer. In this repository you a variety of algorithms, data structures, and creative programming tasks will be tackled.
